You can get full credit by doing the problem set with the *suggested* data set (spotify.csv), but you can get **extra credit** by doing it with a different dataset that you have found on the Internet (for example, on Kaggle.com) and/or doing more analysis than required.  You also have the opportunity to get **additional extra credit applied to your final exam grade** if you are selected to give a lightning talk on **Apr 28** about what you found with this project.  The lightning talk is only possible if you chose your own dataset."

(The suggested dataset should also drop the first 'Unnamed' column - that row number predicts the genre number pretty well in that dataset!)

        "Based on our Random Forests' feature importances and our Linear Regression's coefficients, I learned that the US Trade Deficit was very influential in determining the current tariff rate Trump set. Other factors, such as a country's population, were very arbitrary and held little bearing on the amount a country was taxed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, we can see that one of the largest factor was the US Trade Deficit, both in our Random Forests and in our Linear Regression. As deficit increased, tariff response increased. This supports the argument that Trump is motivated to make the US seem less \"indebted\" to other countries-- though whether or not Trade Deficit is actually harmful is up for debate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Linear Regression coefficients show that as Exports increased, tariff rates decreased. Meanwhile, as Import increased, tariff rates increased. This supports the argument that Trump follows a mercantilist policy and seeks to have the US less \"indebted\" to other countries by ensuring that the US puts out more than it takes in. Additionally, we may conclude that Trump's tariffs are likely intended as a protective measure to raise the cost of imports so that US consumers will \"buy American\" instead. (I could discuss how that's actually a bad idea based on basic economics, but that's not related to our data here.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Decision Trees and Linear Regression gave us conflicting information on the importance of Exports and Imports. Since regression is sensitive to outliers, it is likely that a few outlier countries--perhaps China-- are causing this discrepancy. The fact that there are extreme outliers highlights how different countries are treated-- many are treated under a blanket policy of 10% tariff rates, while others of geopolitical significance get radically different and irregular treatment."
